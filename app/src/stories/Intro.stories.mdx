# Welcome

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

# What is KendoReact

KendoReact is a commercial UI library designed and built for developing business applications with React. Every UI component in the KendoReact suite has been built from the ground-up specifically for React.


All KendoReact components are distributed through npm packages available through npm. Please keep in mind that in order to use the npm packages you should either sign up for a **30-day free trial**, or be a **licensed developer**, as KendoReact has a **commercial license**. The trial also grants free access to our outstanding technical support.

The KendoReact library contains UI components that range from advanced components including the data grid, charts and gauges, rich text editor, and scheduler â€“ to form elements such as date pickers, dropdowns, and various inputs. There are also helper libraries such as PDF and Excel processing packages.

For a full list of all available UI components, helper utilities, and accompanying documentation articles please refer to the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/">KendoReact components list</a>.
